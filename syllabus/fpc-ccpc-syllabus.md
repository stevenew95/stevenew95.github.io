## Required Textbooks
{: .section-container}

1. "Critical Care Transport" by American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)
2. "Flight Paramedic Certification: A Comprehensive Study Guide" by Kyle Faudree
3. "The Clinical Practice of Flight and Critical Care Parasitology" by Cheryl Bagley Thompson, et al.

## Additional Resources
{: .section-container}

- Access to online learning management system for supplementary materials, quizzes, and discussion forums
- Simulation lab with high-fidelity mannequins and transport equipment
- Guest lectures from active flight paramedics and critical care specialists

## Attendance Policy
{: .section-container}

Due to the intensive nature of this course, full attendance is strongly encouraged. This is not a pass or fail course, but rather a preparation course that will prepare you for the critical care and flight paramedic examinations, while also equiping you with an extensive amount of knowledge beyodnd the paramedic role. In order to recieve a completion certificate, you must attend at least 224 of the 256 hours that this course is designed to take. If you fail to meet those hours, you will still obtain a certificate of attendace for the hours completed and continuing education credits. 

## Safety Protocols
{: .section-container}

All students must adhere to safety protocols during lab and simulation sessions. This includes proper use of PPE, following infection control guidelines, and adhering to all equipment safety procedures.

## Certification Exam Preparation
{: .section-container}

This course is designed to prepare students to sit for both the CCP-C and FP-C exams. However, completing this course does not guarantee certification. Students are encouraged to utilize additional study resources and take practice exams before attempting the official certification exams.
